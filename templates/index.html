        <p class="text-1">Type 1 of diabetes that indicates human’s body unable to generate sufficient insulin and required to rely on insulin injection. 
            Globally, it was estimated that type 1 diabetes accounted for roughly 2% of all instances of diabetes worldwide, ranging from less 
            than 1% in some Pacific Island nations and more than 15% in Northern European populations.</p>
        
        <p class="text-1">Those with this type of diabetes may be suffering from an autoimmune reaction that inhibits your pancreas from making insulin. 
            Having type 1 diabetes can happen at any point of your life, but it is more common in children and adolescents. Your doctor may prescribe 
            you to undergo insulin therapy to help address your condition. This means that you may need to take insulin for the rest of your life 
            to help maintain healthy levels of glucose.</p>

        <p class="text-1">Type 2 of diabetes is the most prevalent kind of diabetes, which is characterised by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance,
            and a relative lack of insulin. Type 2 diabetes was caused by the convergence of genetic, environmental, 
            and behavioural risk factors. People with type 2 diabetes are more sensitive to several brief and long problems,
            which higher probability in early mortality. This kind of diabetes is usually found in middle-aged and older adults.</p>
        
        <p class="text-1">The exact reason why your body suddenly starts becoming insulin-resistant remains unknown, but family history of diabetes and an unhealthy 
            lifestyle can greatly increase your risk levels. It is generally recommended that you start living a healthier lifestyle when you are at 
            risk or are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes to help regulate your blood sugar. If a balanced diet and an active lifestyle doesn’t work out for you,
            your doctor will design an individualized treatment plan is designed to help manage your condition.</p>

        <p class="text-1">Gestational diabetes comes from hormonal changes, and the way our bodies convert food into energy. A hormone called insulin breaks down the 
            glucose (sugar) from food and delivers it to our cells. Insulin keeps the level of glucose in our blood at a healthy level. But if insulin doesn’t 
            work right or we don’t have enough of it, sugar builds up in the blood and leads to diabetes. Healthcare provider tests for gestational diabetes around 
            weeks 24 to 28 of your pregnancy. At this stage, hormones start getting produced by the placenta. This organ forms in the uterus and supplies the baby 
            with oxygen and nutrients. The hormones it makes can interfere with insulin.</p>
        
        <p class="text-1">Healthcare provider will test your blood sugar during pregnancy. The test may have two parts:<br><br>
            <strong>Glucose challenge test: </strong>You drink a sweet liquid. After about an hour, you’ll have a blood 
                  test to check your blood sugar level. If your blood sugar is high, your healthcare provider will do a glucose tolerance test.<br><br>
            <strong>Glucose tolerance test: </strong> An oral glucose tolerance test is only done if your challenge test results are unusual. You fast (don’t eat for eight hours) before the tolerance test. 
                  Your healthcare provider draws your blood before and after you drink a sweet liquid. The tolerance test can confirm a diagnosis of gestational diabetes.</p>
